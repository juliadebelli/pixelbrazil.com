#### CONTRIBUTING

This is my first open-source experience as a mantainer so please expect everything to be a WIP! It all started as an experiment, then a community file on Figma, then based @ricalamino made it in CSS. I deployed his code on pixelbrazil.com and started this repo.

So this is it? Accepting anything creative ðŸ¤
